BECKAROO & THE ZOO
--------------------

When people find out how many animals my wife and I own they always ask the same two questions,
"What kind of animals do you have and how do you take care of all of them?". My wife and I always
have a lot of fun talking to people about our little zoo, so I decided to create Beckaroo & The Zoo to
share our life with the world. When the website is complete people that visit my site will be able to
see all of our different animals on "The Zoo" tab and read fun stories about our different adventures on
the "Daily Tails" tab.
